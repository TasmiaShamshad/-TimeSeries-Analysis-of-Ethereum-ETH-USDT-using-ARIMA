# -TimeSeries-Analysis-of-Ethereum-ETH-USDT-using-ARIMA
This project focuses on forecasting Ethereum's (ETH) closing prices using time series modeling techniques. The core objective is to build a statistical model that can predict future price movements and evaluate its performance based on historical data.
 Project Overview
Dataset: Historical Ethereum daily closing prices from 2021 to mid-2025

Model Used: ARIMA(0,1,1) with log transformation

Training Period: Jan 2021 to Mar 2024

Testing Period: Mar 2024 to Jun 2025

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAPE

ðŸ›  Key Components
Data Preprocessing: Log transformation and differencing to ensure stationarity

Model Training: ARIMA model fitted on the last 1500 days of data

Forecasting: Out-of-sample prediction for over 12 months

Visualization: Comparison of forecasted prices vs actual test data

Error Analysis:

RMSE â‰ˆ 897

MAPE â‰ˆ 27.3%

Observations: The ARIMA model produced a flat forecast, failing to capture high volatility in Ethereum prices.

ðŸ“‰ Limitations
Model underfit the test data due to lack of reactivity to market fluctuations

ARIMA may not be suitable for highly volatile assets like cryptocurrencies

âœ… Future Improvements
Integrate SARIMA, GARCH, or LSTM models for improved performance

Incorporate external features like volume, market sentiment, or macro indicators

Use rolling forecasts to simulate real-world prediction scenarios

ðŸ“Š Visualization

Ethereum Forecast vs Actual using ARIMA(0,1,1) â€” flat forecast despite volatile actual trend (can be used further and fixed by SARIMA model)
